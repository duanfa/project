<li><b>2　about</b>
	<p> This new mobile application is meant to engage a very specific target audience: 14-24 year olds living in the Bay Area of California. It will provide a seamless user experience that is simple to interface with, and fully branded with Be the Street personality (note: the prototype mock-up aims to show examples of the functionality of various components; it does not currently include that layer of branding or a perfected user interface). Through the game, which can be played anywhere at any time, our audience is given a way to have fun, invite groups of friends, compete against similar groups, and have meaningful experiences at fun events and challenges. First virtually, and then in reality, the game builds awareness and a sense of stewardship in our target audience by getting players to engage with litter/pollution-related items and locations found directly on the streets of their own neighborhoods。</b></p>
</li>	
<li><b>3　useage</b>
　　<p>A Players use Google Street View to hunt for target items that are related to pollution/litter (e.g. storm drains, trash cans, recycle bins, etc.). When items are found, players submit screenshots, which earns them points and allows them to collect more target items to find. They eventually unlock “LIVE mode” which lets them search for the target items in the real world and submit photos using their built-in smartphone cameras. Players also rate the screenshot/photo submissions of other players to verify that they contain the correct target items. Players can create or join groups (teams) which compete against other similar groups. Groups are based on real world groups/organizations/activities affiliated with high schools, universities, or outside of school. Within the app there is a message feed, where players receive invitations to challenges or events hosted by BeTheStreet。</p>
